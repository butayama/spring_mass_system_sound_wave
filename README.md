This is a simulation of a monoatomic mass spring system.
It is used to visualize the different speed of sound traveling in the medium.
With a different relation of the spring constant k divided by the mass m (k/m),
the speed of the traveling wave changes.

The mass at position 0 is forced to move in a sine function for a period of time, and then it is shut down.
The wave generated travel through the medium and bounces at the end and the motion continues.

Increasing the relation k/m increases the speed of the traveling wave, which can be seen on the plot
of the position as a function of time of the mass-spring system with all the masses.

To modify the variables of the system, it can be edited in the input.txt file, which contains important parameters for the simulation.
Please keep the order of the parameters as it is in the file, the read_variables function reads them and return them in that order.
